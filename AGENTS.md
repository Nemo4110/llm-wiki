# Agent Implementation Guide

> This document guides Claude Code, OpenClaw, and other AI Agents on how to use llm-wiki.
> **All Agents operating in this project directory MUST read and understand `SKILL.md` before performing any task.**

## Mandatory Pre-Flight Checklist

Before executing any wiki-related task, every Agent MUST:

1. **Read `SKILL.md`** — Understand the machine-readable specification, entry points, functions, and dependencies.
2. **Read `CLAUDE.md`** — Understand the core protocol and behavioral rules.
3. **Run `python scripts/agent-bridge.py check`** — Verify the runtime environment.
4. **Respect `sources/` integrity** — Never write LLM-generated content into `sources/`.

Failure to follow the above may result in corrupted knowledge base, fabricated sources, or broken cross-references.

---

## Agent Tool Selection Guide

> **STOP. Before doing any wiki task, read this section.**
>
> This project provides a single unified entry point for Agents: **`scripts/agent-bridge.py`**.
> You do NOT need to remember multiple CLI commands. You do NOT need to check if dependencies are installed.
> Just run `python scripts/agent-bridge.py check` at the start of each session.

### Mandatory Pre-Task Check

Before any wiki operation, run:

```bash
python scripts/agent-bridge.py check
```

This produces a structured Markdown report telling you:
- Whether the environment is ready
- How many wiki pages exist
- Whether embedding/linking features are enabled
- Which Python interpreter will be used

**Do not skip this step.** It eliminates all uncertainty about "is CLI installed?"

### Python Environment Rule

All Python operations in this project MUST use the project's own virtual environment:

1. **If `.venv/` exists** in the project root → use `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` (Windows) or `.venv/bin/python` (Linux/macOS). Prefer `uv run python` when uv is available.
2. **If no `.venv/` but conda is available** → use `conda run -n llm-wiki python`.
3. **Never use system Python** or global pip directly.

This ensures consistent dependency versions and avoids environment pollution. When running tests, use:

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/        # Windows
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/                # Linux/macOS
```

### Task Type Quick Reference

Every wiki task falls into exactly one of three categories. **The category determines which tool you use.**

| Category | Task | Needs LLM? | You Use | If Unavailable |
|----------|------|-----------|---------|---------------|
| **A** | Link discovery | No | `agent-bridge.py link` | Fallback: read files directly |
| **A** | Batch relink | No | `agent-bridge.py relink` | Fallback: run `link` per page |
| **A** | Health check | No | `agent-bridge.py lint` | Fallback: manual inspection |
| **A** | Status overview | No | `agent-bridge.py status` | Fallback: count files in wiki/ |
| **A** | Embedding index | No | `agent-bridge.py index` | Skip semantic search |
| **A** | Safe merge | No | `agent-bridge.py merge` | Manual edit with diff review |
| **A** | Semantic query | No | `agent-bridge.py query --semantic` | Fallback to keyword listing |
| **B** | Ingest material | **Yes** | Protocol mode (direct file ops) | N/A |
| **B** | Query & synthesize | **Yes** | Protocol mode (direct file ops) | N/A |
| **C** | Apply link results | **Agent judges** | `merge` (after reviewing diff) | Manual edit |

**Category A**: Pure algorithm. No LLM intelligence needed. **Always use `agent-bridge.py`.**

**Category B**: Requires LLM understanding, insight extraction, or creative synthesis. **Always use Protocol mode** (read/write files directly).

**Category C**: Hybrid. The tool discovers candidates (Category A), but you use LLM judgment to decide whether to apply them.

---

### Why agent-bridge.py Exists

The old documentation told you "Protocol mode = operate files directly" and also "run `wiki link` commands". This created mixed signals. You (the Agent) naturally chose the path with lowest cognitive uncertainty: writing Python code yourself.

**`agent-bridge.py` solves this by being the single obvious choice for all Category A tasks.**

It handles internally:
- Finding the right Python interpreter (venv, conda, system)
- Checking if `src.llm_wiki` is importable
- Calling the library code directly (no subprocess overhead)
- Producing structured Markdown output (no JSON to parse)
- Logging every internal step to stderr with file:line precision (fully visible)

You see the full execution trace, so it is never a black box.

---

## Category A Tasks: Use agent-bridge.py

### 1. Link Discovery

**When**: After creating a new wiki page during ingest. Discover which existing pages are related.

```bash
python scripts/agent-bridge.py link --source "NewPage" --mode light
```

**Output sections**:
- `## Relation Discovery: <Page>` — summary
- `### Relations` — table of candidates with score, type, evidence
- `### Actionable Items` — high-confidence relations with suggested next commands

**Your action**: Review the `[ACTION]` markers. For score >= 0.5 relations, run the suggested `--dry-run` merge command first, review the diff, then apply.

**Example workflow**:

```
Agent:
1. Run: python scripts/agent-bridge.py link --source "LoRA" --mode light
2. Read output: finds [[Fine-tuning]] score=0.78 type=EXTENDS
3. Run dry-run merge:
   python scripts/agent-bridge.py merge --source "LoRA" --target "Fine-tuning" \
       --strategy append_related --dry-run
4. Review diff in output
5. If reasonable, re-run without --dry-run
```

### 2. Batch Global Relink

**When**: After ingesting 2+ sources. Discover cross-page relations for all recent pages at once.

```bash
python scripts/agent-bridge.py relink --since 2026-04-20 --mode deep --dry-run
```

Remove `--dry-run` after reviewing the relation report.

### 3. Health Check (Lint)

**When**: Periodic maintenance, or user asks "check wiki health".

```bash
python scripts/agent-bridge.py lint
```

**Output sections**:
- `## Summary` — count table for orphans, dead links, stale, drafts
- `## Orphan Pages` — pages not referenced by any other
- `## Dead Links` — `[[Non-existent page]]` references
- `## Stale Pages` — >90 days since last update
- `## Draft Pages`

**Your action**: For dead links, create stub pages. For orphans, consider adding backlinks from relevant pages.

### 4. Status Overview

**When**: User asks "what's in the wiki?" or you need context before a task.

```bash
python scripts/agent-bridge.py status
```

### 5. Semantic Query (when embedding enabled)

**When**: User asks a question and `embedding.enabled: true` in config.yaml. This finds candidate pages via vector search; you then read those pages and synthesize the answer.

```bash
python scripts/agent-bridge.py query "What is LoRA?" --semantic
```

**Output sections**:
- `## Semantic Results` — ranked table of relevant pages
- `[ACTION] Agent: Read the top-ranked pages and synthesize an answer with citations.`

**Your action**: Read the listed pages, then synthesize an answer. Do NOT treat the semantic results as the final answer.

### 6. Safe Merge

**When**: Applying a relation update to an existing page. Always produces a diff for review.

```bash
# Preview
python scripts/agent-bridge.py merge --source "NewPage" --target "OldPage" \
    --strategy append_related --dry-run

# Apply
python scripts/agent-bridge.py merge --source "NewPage" --target "OldPage" \
    --strategy append_related
```

### 7. Embedding Index

**When**: After adding new pages and embedding is enabled. Build/update the vector index.

```bash
python scripts/agent-bridge.py index
```

---

## Category B Tasks: Use Protocol Mode (Direct File Operations)

### Ingest

**Never** use a CLI command for ingest. Ingest requires LLM intelligence to:
- Understand the source material
- Extract key insights
- Decide page structure and cross-references
- Write frontmatter and content

```
User: Please ingest sources/paper.pdf

Agent (Protocol mode):
1. Read sources/paper.pdf (use appropriate file reader)
2. Extract key insights via LLM
3. Create wiki/NewConcept.md with proper frontmatter
4. Create stub pages for any new [[Dead Link]]
5. Run agent-bridge.py link --source "NewConcept" --mode light
6. Review high-confidence relations, run merge --dry-run for each
7. Update wiki/index.md
8. Append log.md
```

### Query (without embedding)

When embedding is disabled, query is pure Protocol mode:

```
User: What's the difference between LoRA and full fine-tuning?

Agent (Protocol mode):
1. Read wiki/index.md to locate relevant topics
2. Read wiki/LoRA.md and linked neighbors
3. Synthesize answer with citations: [[LoRA]], [[Fine-tuning]]
4. Judge: Is this answer worth archiving?
```

---

## Category C Tasks: Hybrid (Tool Discovery + Agent Judgment)

### Applying Link Results

This is the only task that requires both `agent-bridge.py` AND your LLM judgment.

```
Agent:
1. Run: python scripts/agent-bridge.py link --source "Bid2X" --mode light
2. Read output. For each relation with score >= 0.5:
   a. Read the target existing page
   b. LLM analysis: "Bid2X is an improvement over RTBAgent, extending xxx"
   c. Decision: Use append_related strategy
   d. Run: python scripts/agent-bridge.py merge --source "Bid2X" --target "RTBAgent" \
          --strategy append_related --dry-run
   e. Review diff in output
   f. If reasonable, re-run without --dry-run
3. Update log.md
```

---

## Execution Visibility: Logging

All `agent-bridge.py` commands and the underlying library code emit structured logs to **stderr**.

Format:
```
[INFO] src/llm_wiki/linker.py:187 find_related() | find_related: query=LoRA mode=kw_w=0.6 vec_w=0.0 link_w=0.4 top_k=5 min_score=0.30
[DEBUG] src/llm_wiki/linker.py:204 find_related() | Query keywords extracted: 42 terms
[DEBUG] src/llm_wiki/linker.py:210 find_related() | Phase 1: keyword match (weight=0.6)
[DEBUG] src/llm_wiki/linker.py:313 find_related() | Phase 3: link proximity skipped (weight=0.0)
[INFO] src/llm_wiki/linker.py:342 find_related() | find_related complete: 3 relations above min_score (returning top 5)
```

Every log line includes:
- **Log level**: INFO / DEBUG / WARNING / ERROR
- **File path**: relative to project root
- **Line number**: exact source line
- **Function name**: which method emitted the log
- **Message**: what happened

**Why this matters**: You can trace the full execution pipeline. If a relation is missing, you can see which phase (keyword/vector/link) filtered it out. If embedding fails, you see the exact exception. Nothing is hidden.

To see full debug output, add `--verbose` to any direct CLI command:
```bash
python -m src.llm_wiki --verbose link --source "X" --mode light
```

---

## Sources Directory Write Rules

> The integrity of `sources/` is the foundation of the entire knowledge base. Once raw materials are polluted, all derived wiki content loses credibility.

### Two Allowed Cases for Writing to `sources/`

| Case | Condition | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| A | User manually placed a file | Read-only, do not modify |
| B | User provided a URL/DOI and the file is not yet in `sources/` | Use network tools to fetch, verify non-empty and correct format, then write |

### Absolute Prohibitions

- **NEVER** save LLM-generated text, summaries, or speculative content as `.md`, `.txt`, or any format into `sources/`
- **NEVER** claim "downloaded" and create files without actually executing a network request
- **NEVER** "fall back" to generated content when fetching fails

### Standard Network Fetch Template

**Direct download (PDF, text files)**:

```bash
# Check if URL is reachable
curl -I -L "https://example.com/paper.pdf"

# Download to sources/
curl -L -o "sources/YYYY-MM-DD-description.pdf" "https://example.com/paper.pdf"

# Verify file is non-empty
ls -la "sources/YYYY-MM-DD-description.pdf"
```

**Rendered web pages (tech blogs, dynamic content)**:

Use Playwright tools to fetch page content:

```bash
# Use playwright to get rendered page
playwright screenshot --full-page "https://tech.blog.example.com/article" "sources/temp-screenshot.png"
```

Or use a Python script to get text:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch()
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://tech.blog.example.com/article")
    text = page.inner_text("article")  # or appropriate selector
    with open("sources/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        f.write(text)
    browser.close()
```

**DOI resolution**:

```bash
# DOI usually redirects to publisher pages; paywalls may apply
curl -L -o "sources/paper.html" "https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx"

# Prefer open-access versions like arXiv
curl -L -o "sources/paper.pdf" "https://arxiv.org/pdf/xxxxx.pdf"
```

### Post-Fetch Verification Protocol

> Downloading is not enough. You MUST verify the file content matches what the user requested before ingesting.

After every successful network fetch, before writing to `sources/` or proceeding with ingest, perform the following verification:

#### Verification Checklist

| # | Check | How | If Failed |
|---|-------|-----|-----------|
| 1 | File is readable | Attempt to read/parse the file | STOP — file may be corrupted |
| 2 | Not an error page | Scan for `404`, `Access Denied`, `Please enable JavaScript`, `Subscribe`, `Login` | STOP — treat as fetch failure |
| 3 | Format matches extension | PDF starts with `%PDF`; HTML has `<html`; MD is plain text | WARN — rename extension if needed |
| 4 | Title matches expectation | Extract title/heading and compare to user's description | STOP if clearly wrong; ask user if uncertain |
| 5 | Identifiers match (if provided) | Extract DOI, arXiv ID, author names; compare to user input | STOP if mismatch |

#### Extracting Verifiable Identifiers by File Type

**PDF (academic papers)**:

Use Python to extract text from the first 1-2 pages, then look for:

```python
import fitz  # PyMuPDF

doc = fitz.open("sources/downloaded-paper.pdf")
text = ""
for page in doc[:2]:  # first 2 pages
    text += page.get_text()
doc.close()

# Extract identifiers
import re
doi = re.search(r'10\.\d{4,}/[^\s]+', text)
arXiv = re.search(r'arXiv:\d{4}\.\d{4,}', text, re.I)
# Title is usually the largest text block on page 1
```

**Markdown / HTML / Text**:

Use Read tool directly. Extract:
- First `# Heading` or `<title>` tag
- First paragraph as summary check

**All file types**:

Check for error-page signatures:
- `404 Not Found`, `403 Forbidden`
- `Access Denied`, `Subscription Required`
- `Please enable JavaScript`, `Cloudflare`
- Empty or near-empty content (< 100 bytes for text files)

#### Mismatch Handling Flow

```
Verification result
    |
    +-- PASS (confident match)
    |     -> Write to sources/ -> Continue normal ingest
    |
    +-- FAIL (clear mismatch or error page)
    |     -> Do NOT write to sources/ (or delete if already written)
    |     -> Do NOT create wiki pages
    |     -> Do NOT log as "ingested"
    |     -> Record in log.md: "[Date] verify-failed | Filename — reason"
    |     -> Reply to user with extracted vs expected metadata
    |     -> Await user instruction
    |
    +-- UNCERTAIN (cannot extract or ambiguous)
          -> Report extracted metadata to user
          -> Ask: "Extracted title: 'X'. Is this the correct file?"
          -> Only proceed after explicit user confirmation
```

#### Example: Verification Pass

```
User: Please ingest https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf (the LoRA paper)

Agent: curl -L -o sources/2106.09685.pdf https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf
       python (extract text from first 2 pages)
       -> Title: "LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models"
       -> Authors: "Edward J. Hu, Yelong Shen, Phillip Wallis"
       -> arXiv ID: arXiv:2106.09685
       -> Compare to user description: "LoRA paper" — MATCH
       -> Verification: PASS
       -> Continue with ingest
```

#### Example: Verification Fail

```
User: Please ingest https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf (the LoRA paper)

Agent: curl -L -o sources/2106.09685.pdf https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf
       python (extract text)
       -> Title: "Attention Is All You Need"  <- Wrong paper!
       -> arXiv ID: arXiv:1706.03762         <- Mismatch
       -> Verification: FAIL
       -> Do NOT ingest
       -> Report to user: "Downloaded file is 'Attention Is All You Need' (arXiv:1706.03762),
          but you requested the LoRA paper (2106.09685). Please check the URL."
```

#### Example: Error Page Detected

```
User: Please ingest https://example.com/paywalled-paper.pdf

Agent: curl -L -o sources/paper.pdf https://example.com/paywalled-paper.pdf
       python (read file)
       -> Content contains: "Subscribe to access this article"
       -> Verification: FAIL (error page)
       -> Do NOT ingest
       -> Record in log.md: verify-failed — paywall
       -> Report to user with alternatives
```

### Fetch Failure Handling Flow

```
Fetch attempt
    |
    +-- Success -> Run Post-Fetch Verification -> PASS -> Write to sources/ -> Continue ingest
    |                        |
    |                        +-- FAIL -> Do NOT write to sources/ -> Report to user
    |
    +-- Failure (404/403/paywall/anti-bot)
          |
          +--> Do NOT create any file in sources/
          +--> Create or update [[Pending: SourceName]] stub page in wiki/
          +--> Record failure reason in log.md
          +--> Reply to user explaining the situation and request assistance
```

### Correct vs Incorrect Examples

**Incorrect** (absolutely forbidden):

```
User: Please ingest these papers [provides 5 titles, no URLs]

Agent: (Did not execute any curl/playwright call)
      Directly creates sources/paper-1.md with LLM-generated "summary"
      Then creates wiki pages based on fabricated content
```

**Correct** (no URL, Agent proactively searches):

```
User: Please ingest these papers [provides 5 titles, no URLs]

Agent: Uses WebSearch to find open-access versions for each title
      -> Found arXiv link for paper 1, author homepage PDF for paper 2
      Replies to user: "I found the following possible sources, please confirm:
      1. Paper Title 1 -> https://arxiv.org/pdf/xxxx.pdf
      2. Paper Title 2 -> https://author-page.edu/paper2.pdf
      I will download and ingest after your confirmation."
      (User confirms -> Execute curl download -> Continue ingest)
```

**Correct** (URL provided):

```
User: Please ingest https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.xxxxx.pdf

Agent: Execute curl -L -o "sources/2026-04-20-paper.pdf" "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.xxxxx.pdf"
      Verify file size > 0
      Read PDF content
      Continue normal ingest flow
```

**Correct** (fetch failed):

```
User: Please ingest https://example.com/paywalled-paper.pdf

Agent: Execute curl -I "https://example.com/paywalled-paper.pdf"
      -> Returns 403 Forbidden
      Do NOT create sources/ file
      Create wiki/Pending-Paywalled-Paper.md (stub, marked as pending)
      Record in log.md: "[Date] pending | Paywall prevented fetching xxx"
      Reply to user: "This paper requires paid access; I cannot fetch it automatically.
      Please download manually and place in sources/, or provide an open-access link."
```

## File Type Processing Strategy

> **Key principle**: Different file types require different reading strategies; avoid using the Read tool directly on binary files.

### Decision Tree

```
File Type Recognition
    |
    +-- Text files (.md, .txt, .json, .yaml, .py, .js, etc.)
    |     +--> Use Read tool directly
    |
    +-- PDF files (.pdf)
    |     +-- Check dependency: is PyMuPDF (pymupdf) installed?
    |     |     +-- Yes -> Use Python script to read
    |     |     +-- No  -> Install dependency first, then read
    |     +--> Process via scripts/read_pdf.py or Python code
    |
    +-- Image files (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, etc.)
    |     +--> Use Read tool (vision model supported)
    |
    +-- Office documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx)
    |     +--> Requires python-docx / openpyxl, etc.
    |
    +-- Other binary formats
          +--> Find or create corresponding Python processing script
```

### PDF File Processing Detailed Flow

**Step 1: Check dependency**

```bash
# Check if PyMuPDF is installed
python -c "import fitz; print(fitz.__doc__[:30])"
```

If it fails, install first:

```bash
pip install pymupdf>=1.25.0
```

**Step 2: Read PDF content**

**Method A: Use existing script**

```bash
# Read all pages
python scripts/read_pdf.py sources/paper.pdf

# Read specific page range
python scripts/read_pdf.py sources/paper.pdf 1-10
```

**Method B: Use Python code (Recommended: PyMuPDF)**

```python
import fitz  # PyMuPDF

doc = fitz.open("sources/paper.pdf")
for page in doc:
    print(page.get_text())
doc.close()
```

**Fallback: pdfplumber (table extraction)**

If PyMuPDF performs poorly on complex tables, fall back to `pdfplumber` (note: install secure version >= 0.11.8 to fix CVE-2025-64512):

```python
import pdfplumber

with pdfplumber.open("sources/paper.pdf") as pdf:
    for page in pdf.pages:
        print(page.extract_text())
```

**OCR last resort**

For scanned PDFs or when all above methods fail, use `pdf2image` + `pytesseract` for OCR.

**PDF extraction quality fallback**

If pdfplumber produces garbled text (especially with Chinese, special fonts, or complex academic layouts), try these alternatives:

**Method C: Use PyMuPDF (fitz)**

PyMuPDF is typically more reliable for CJK fonts and complex PDF text extraction:

```bash
# Install
pip install pymupdf
```

```python
import fitz  # PyMuPDF

doc = fitz.open("sources/paper.pdf")
for page in doc:
    print(page.get_text())
```

**Method D: Convert to images then OCR (last resort)**

For scanned PDFs or when all above methods fail, use `pdf2image` + `pytesseract` for OCR — slower but more robust.

### Text File Processing

Use Read tool directly:

```python
# Directly read Markdown, text, code files
Read("sources/notes.md")
Read("sources/config.yaml")
Read("sources/script.py")
```

### Image File Processing

Read tool supports vision models:

```python
# Read tool can process images and return visual content
Read("sources/diagram.png")
Read("sources/screenshot.jpg")
```

### Dependency Management

**Dependency file location**: `src/requirements.txt`

**Included dependencies**:
- `click>=8.0.0` - CLI framework
- `pyyaml>=6.0` - YAML parsing
- `pymupdf>=1.25.0` - PDF processing (PyMuPDF, supports CJK fonts and complex layouts)

**Fallback dependencies** (only when PyMuPDF table extraction is poor):
- `pdfplumber>=0.11.8` - PDF table extraction (secure version required for CVE-2025-64512)
- `pdfminer.six>=20251107` - PDF underlying library

**Installation commands**:

```bash
# Using conda (recommended)
conda activate llm-wiki
pip install -r src/requirements.txt

# Using pip
pip install -r src/requirements.txt

# Using uv (if you have it)
uv pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

---

## Old CLI Commands (Still Available)

The underlying `python -m src.llm_wiki` CLI remains available for human users and scripting. As an Agent, **prefer `agent-bridge.py`** because it:
- Auto-detects the environment
- Produces structured Markdown output
- Has unified error handling

If you need to use the lower-level CLI directly, see the command reference below.

### Direct CLI Command Reference

```bash
# Using virtual environment Python (preferred)
PY=".venv/Scripts/python"  # Windows
PY=".venv/bin/python"      # Linux/macOS

# Check availability
$PY -m src.llm_wiki --help

# Status
$PY -m src.llm_wiki status

# Lint
$PY -m src.llm_wiki lint

# Link (human-readable markdown output)
$PY -m src.llm_wiki link --source "NewPage" --mode light

# Relink
$PY -m src.llm_wiki relink --since 2026-04-20 --mode deep

# Index
$PY -m src.llm_wiki index
```

| Command | Purpose | Agent Should Use Instead |
|---------|---------|------------------------|
| `status` | Wiki overview | `agent-bridge.py status` |
| `lint` | Health check | `agent-bridge.py lint` |
| `link` | Relation discovery | `agent-bridge.py link` |
| `relink` | Batch global linking | `agent-bridge.py relink` |
| `index` | Build embedding index | `agent-bridge.py index` |
| `ingest` | Preview only (no LLM) | **Protocol mode** (direct file ops) |
| `query` | List pages / semantic search | `agent-bridge.py query` for semantic; **Protocol mode** for synthesis |

## Bidirectional Update Implementation Guide

> This section guides Agents on how to perform dynamic linking and bidirectional updates during ingest.

### Why Bidirectional Updates Are Needed

Traditional ingest only creates new pages; existing pages do not automatically reflect new knowledge. Bidirectional updates let the knowledge base **self-improve** over time:
- New paper improves an old method -> old page automatically gets "Latest Progress" section
- New work contrasts with old work -> both pages add comparison links
- New work depends on old concept -> old concept page gets backlink

### Linking Workflow

```
Finish new page creation
    |
    v
+------------------------------------------+
| 1. Run: agent-bridge.py link --source PAGE  |  <-- discovers relations
|            --mode light                  |
+------------------------------------------+
    |
    v
+------------------------------------------+
| 2. Agent reviews relation report         |  <-- LLM judges relevance
|    Only process score >= 0.5             |

|    a. Read existing page                 |
|    b. Analyze old vs new                 |

### Merge Strategy Decision Tree

```
Relation between new page and existing page
    |
    +-- Same field, different work
    |     +--> link_only (add to "Related Pages")
    |
    +-- New work extends/improves old method
    |     +--> append_section (add "Latest Progress")
    |
    +-- New work contrasts with old work
    |     +--> append_section (add "Comparison with xxx")
    |     +--> append_related (bidirectional links)
    |
    +-- New work corrects old concept
    |     +--> update_concept (update definition, use with care)
    |     +--> append_section (add "Concept Evolution")
    |
    +-- New work heavily depends on old concept
          +--> append_related (add backlink to old page)
```

### Agent Implementation Pattern (Protocol Mode)

**Scenario: User requests ingesting sources/new-paper.pdf**

```
Agent:
1. Read sources/new-paper.pdf
2. Extract insights, create wiki/NewMethod.md
3. Check dead links, create stub pages
4. Run: python scripts/agent-bridge.py link --source "NewMethod" --mode light
   -> Get relation report
5. For score >= 0.5 relations, e.g. [[OldMethod]]:
   a. Read wiki/OldMethod.md
   b. LLM analysis: "NewMethod is an improvement over OldMethod, extending xxx capabilities"
   c. Decision: Use append_section strategy, append "Relationship with NewMethod"
   d. Run: python scripts/agent-bridge.py merge --source "NewMethod" --target "OldMethod" \
          --strategy append_section --dry-run
   e. Review diff, confirm it is reasonable
   f. Apply modification (remove --dry-run)
6. Update log.md, record new pages and relation updates
7. Update wiki/index.md
```

### Safety Rules

1. **Always --dry-run first**: Generate diff for review before applying
2. **Append only, never replace**: `append_related` and `append_section` are safe strategies
3. **Use update_concept with caution**: Only when new information genuinely corrects an old definition
4. **Limit batch updates**: Single source should trigger no more than 5 backward updates
5. **Automatic backups**: merge tool automatically backs up to `wiki/.backups/`; rollback available

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `agent-bridge.py link` errors: page not found | Confirm page has been created; check title spelling |
| Diff is unreasonable | Do not apply; manually edit the page instead |
| False positive relation to unrelated page | Ignore (score usually < 0.3); do not execute merge |
| Strategy not in allowed list | Check config.yaml `linking.deep_mode.strategies_allowed` |
| Backup directory too large | Manually clean old backups in `wiki/.backups/` |

## Technical Details

### CLI Entry Points

- **Module**: `src.llm_wiki`
- **Main file**: `src/llm_wiki/commands.py`
- **Core logic**: `src/llm_wiki/core.py`
- **Agent Bridge**: `scripts/agent-bridge.py`
- **Logging**: `src/llm_wiki/agent_logger.py`

### Auxiliary Scripts

Project includes auxiliary scripts (`scripts/`):
- `scripts/agent-bridge.py` — **Unified Agent entry point (RECOMMENDED)**
- `scripts/wiki-status.sh` — Quick wiki status view
- `scripts/wiki-lint.sh` — Run health check
- `scripts/init-wiki.sh` — Initialize new project

### Dependencies and Virtual Environment

Dependency file: `src/requirements.txt`
- `click` - Command line framework
- `pyyaml` - YAML parsing

#### Check Dependencies (including virtual environment detection)

```python
import importlib.util
from pathlib import Path
import subprocess
import sys

# 1. Detect virtual environment (uv/venv or conda)
venv_paths = [
    Path(".venv"),           # uv / modern tools
    Path("venv"),            # traditional
]
# Detect conda environment
conda_env = Path(os.environ.get("CONDA_PREFIX", ""))
if conda_env.exists():
    venv_python = conda_env / "python.exe" if sys.platform == "win32" else conda_env / "bin" / "python"
else:
    for venv in venv_paths:
venv_python = None
for venv in venv_paths:
    if venv.exists():
        venv_python = venv / "Scripts" / "python.exe" if sys.platform == "win32" else venv / "bin" / "python"
        break

# Decision path
if venv_python and check_dep("src.llm_wiki", venv_python):
    print(f"Using virtual environment: {venv_python}")
    python_cmd = str(venv_python)
elif check_dep("src.llm_wiki"):
    print("Using system Python")
    python_cmd = "python"
else:
    print("Dependencies not installed; using protocol mode")

# 2. Check if dependency is available
def check_dep(module_name, python_path=None):
    py = python_path or sys.executable
    result = subprocess.run([py, "-c", f"import {module_name}"], capture_output=True)
    return result.returncode == 0
```

### Relationship with CLAUDE.md

- `CLAUDE.md`: Defines **user-visible** working protocol
- `AGENTS.md`: Defines **Agent-internal** implementation strategy
- `SKILL.md`: Machine-readable specification that **ALL Agents MUST read** before operating

They are not contradictory: Protocol mode implements the semantics of CLAUDE.md; agent-bridge.py provides a unified interface for all algorithmic tasks.
